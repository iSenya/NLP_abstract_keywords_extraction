1) File "Keywrds_abs.py" works with previously prepared file "abstracts_001_cleaned.txt"
2) "abstract preprocess.py" shows how the file was prepared. You do not need this code. Just for your information. Initial abstracts were in different languages, with various dilimiters. We cleaned it and created a plain file just with a linebreak between abstracts.
